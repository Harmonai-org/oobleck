It's a working title. Possible backcronyms:
- "Out-of-the-box Latent Encoder Construction Kit"
- "Over-optimized Latent Encoder Construction Kit"

*(Open to other names, we can vote at the end.)*

## What is it?
MIT-licensed soundstream-ish VAE audio codecs for downstream neural audio synthesis.

We will be creating at least 
-  a continuous VAE (for downstream audio diffusion, etc)
-  a vector quantized VAE (for downstream MusicLM, etc)
-  a spherical VAE (for quantum circuits, etc)

We will validate them using
- MUSHRA testing protocol with expert listeners for a subjective performance measure
- visqol and si-snr expert listeners for a subjective performance measure
- FAD?
- ...
- (waiting for the first models to be trained)

We will be experimenting with different loss functions 
- perceptual loss, etc
- place loss functions into [auraloss](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/auraloss) and import it
